Version one is currently envisioned as an unambitious, stable library.
The hope is to minimally capture the basic rules of the game,
and to do so well and reasonably as to attract users.
The interfaces should remain flexible enough that if someone is ambitious enough,
they can capture all the features of CookieClicker.

Version two is envisioned as a more ambitious simulation-engine for CookieClicker.
Ideally, simulation logic would no longer be hard coded but instead come through abstractly.
For example, each piece of CookieClicker (buildings, upgrades, achievements, buffs)
would become an independent unit.
These units would each have a method to query for the next major moment. (expiration, new achievement)
Then the core instance would only be in charge of jumping to the nearest major moment again and again.
