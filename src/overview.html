        <p>The libraries presented in this package can help simulate a game of Cookie Clicker.
            The following guide may be helpful for the uninitiated.</p>
        <p>Cookie Clicker starts with a simple premise, clicking an on-screen cookie for points (cookies),
            that quickly becomes complicated. Cookies can be turned in for buildings,
            objects that produce cookies on their own. Cookies can be turned in for upgrades,
            objects that boost building or clicking production by arbitrary formulas.
            Boosts can also come from Golden Cookies, a temporary click target with various rewards:
            immediate extra cookies, extra clicking production, extra building production, etc.</p>
        <p>These game mechanics are captured in this library.</p>
        <h1>Glossary</h1>
        <p>Below is a collection of terms the API uses commonly.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>core game object - a core game object, is a cookie clicker data structure. Like an inventory
                of buildings, upgrades, buffs, or something as simple as a bank account.
            </li>
            <li>statistic - a statistic is an incrementally increasing tracked number not in the center of
                Cookie Clicker gameplay but important for game checks like achievements or upgrade
                purchases. The biggest example being the number of baked cookies.
            </li>
            <li>measure - a measure is a calculated piece of data that isn't stored by cookie clicker, but
                is used to run or simulate it. A great example is cookies per second. This is a calculated
                number from the core game objects.
            </li>
        </ul>
